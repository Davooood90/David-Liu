# David-Liu

Hello, I'm David Liu, a grade 12 student at Old Scona Academic. While I currently don't have any public repositories, I'm excited to share some personal projects soon! Meanwhile, I invite you to explore YEGYouth.tech, a tech organization that my friends and I founded. Together, we have planned and developed several public projects showcased on our website: https://yegyouth.tech.
