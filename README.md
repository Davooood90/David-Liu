# David-Liu

Hi I'm David Liu, a grade 12 student at Old Scona Academic. For the time being I have no public repositories but just wait as I will be sharing some personal project soon! While you are waiting feel free to check out YEGYouth.tech which is a tech organization that my friends and I founded. As a team we have planned and developed some public projects that you can check out on our website: yegyouth.tech
